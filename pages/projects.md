## Belgian Biodiversity Platform
The [Belgian Biodiversity Platform](https://www.biodiversity.be) is a [BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be) funded initiative that provides services to the scientific community working with biodiversity data, policy-makers as well as to policy-makers and practitioners. Our team is involved in the mobilisation and publication of biodiversity data in an open and standardized manner. The major part of these datasets are registered and published at the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF](https://www.gbif.org).

## GloBAM
[GloBAM](https://globam.science) is a research project funded by [BiodivERsA](https://www.biodiversa.org) with partners from Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. In this project, weather radar data are used to quantify the biomass flows of aerial migrants (birds, insects and bats) from regional to continental scales across Europe and North America, over time-scales from days to years.

## LifeWatch
[LifeWatch Belgium](http://www.lifewatch.be) is part of [LifeWatch ERIC](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), a European infrastructure for biodiversity research. LifeWatch was established as part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure ([ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri)) and became a European Research Infrastructure consortium (ERIC) in 2017. Belgium contributes to LifeWatch ERIC with initiatives from Flanders, Wallonia-Brussels and the federal state. The [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en/) and the [Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ)](http://www.vliz.be/en) are cooperating in the Flemish LifeWatch project, funded by the [Research foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/).

The focus of our team lies on building sensor networks, the publication of biodiversity data, and the development of research software. Our sensor networks include GPS trackers for large birds, an acoustic receiver network for fish, camera traps, groundwater sensors, and climate monitoring. We support researchers from (international) universities and research institutes by publishing open data, building software packages to query and analyze these data and organizing workshops.

## TrIAS
[Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS)](http://trias-project.be) is a [BELSPO](https://www.belspo.be)-funded project that tracks invasive alien species to inform policy using open data and open source software. In this project, fragmented data sources (species lists and observations) are mobilized and published as open data. A reproducible, open and automated workflow is created to publish data and to answer questions of policy concern. Using open data, indicators are developped to detect invading alien species and to conduct risk analyses.

The projects is coordinated by the [Meise Botanic Garden](https://www.plantentuinmeise.be/en), the [Belgian Biodiversity Platform](https://www.biodiversity.be) and the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en).

## Vespa-Watch
[Vespa-Watch](https://vespawatch.be) is a citizen science project funded by the [Department of Economy, Science & Innovation (EWI)](https://www.ewi-vlaanderen.be) coordinated by the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en) and [Honeybee Valley (Ghent University)](https://www.honeybeevalley.eu). The project aims to collect occurrence data of the Asian hornet which is a rapidly spreading invasive species in Western Europe. Bee-keepers, naturalists and citizens collect data that is automatically transferred to the nature app [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) where sightings are validated by experts. Our team is coordinating the development of the website and the data flow to iNaturalist.
