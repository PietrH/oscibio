## LifeWatch

The Belgian LifeWatch project is part of the [European LifeWatch research infrastructure](www.lifewatch.eu) which officially became a European Research Infrastructure consortium (ERIC) in 2017 and can be seen as a virtual laboratory for biodiversity research. Belgium builds LifeWatch ERIC with contributions from Flanders, Wallonia-Brussels and the federal state.
The Open science lab for biodiversity and the [Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ)](www.vliz.be/en) are cooperating in the Flemish LifeWatch project funded by the [Research foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/en/). The focus of our team lies on building sensor networks, the publication of biodiversity data, and the development of research software. Our sensor networks include GPS trackers for large birds, an acoustic receiver network for fish, camera trapping, automated groundwater sensors, and climate monitoring. We aim to involve researchers from (international) universities and research institutes by publishing open data, by building software solutions to query and analyze these data and by organizing workshops.
