## Belgian Biodiversity Platform
The [Belgian Biodiversity Platform](http://www.biodiversity.be) is a [BELSPO](http://www.belspo.be) initiative that provides services to the scientific community working with biodiversity data, policy-makers as well as to policy-makers and practitioners. Our team is involved in the mobilisation and publication of biodiversity data in an open and standardized manner. The major part of these datasets are registered and published at the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF](http://www.gbif.org).

## TrIAS
[Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS)](http://trias-project.be) is a [BELSPO](http://www.belspo.be)-funded project that tracks invasive alien species to inform policy using open data and open source software. In this project, fragmented data sources (species lists and observations) are mobilized and published as open data. A reproducible, open and automated workflow is created to publish data and to answer questions of policy concern. Using open data, indicators are developped to detect invading alien species and to conduct risk analyses.

The projects is coordinated by the [Meise Botanic Garden](http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/en), the [Belgian Biodiversity Platform](http://www.biodiversity.be) and the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](http://www.inbo.be/en).

## LifeWatch

[LifeWatch Belgium](http://www.lifewatch.be) is part of [LifeWatch ERIC](http://www.lifewatch.eu/), a European infrastructure for biodiversity research. LifeWatch was established as part of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure ([ESFRI](http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/index_en.cfm?pg=esfri)) and became a European Research Infrastructure consortium (ERIC) in 2017. Belgium contributes to LifeWatch ERIC with initiatives from Flanders, Wallonia-Brussels and the federal state. The [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](http://www.inbo.be/en/) and the [Flemish Marine Institute (VLIZ)](http://www.vliz.be/en) are cooperating in the Flemish LifeWatch project, funded by the [Research foundation - Flanders (FWO)](http://www.fwo.be/en/).

The focus of our team lies on building sensor networks, the publication of biodiversity data, and the development of research software. Our sensor networks include GPS trackers for large birds, an acoustic receiver network for fish, camera traps, groundwater sensors, and climate monitoring. We support researchers from (international) universities and research institutes by publishing open data, building software packages to query and analyze these data and organizing workshops.
