Summary: Another core data system of the INBO is now available for everyone to use.

We have just published another core data system of the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) as open data: **Watervogels - Wintering waterbirds in Flanders, Belgium**. The dataset joins the systems [Florabank1](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/271c444f-f8d8-4986-b748-e7367755c0c1) and [Fish Information System (VIS)](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?q=vis+-+Fishes)[^1], as well as [numerous other datasets](http://www.gbif.org/publisher/1cd669d0-80ea-11de-a9d0-f1765f95f18b) that have been published and registered via our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit](http://data.inbo.be/ipt). Special thanks to principal investigator Koen Devos (INBO), data liaison officer Dimitri Brosens ([Belgian Biodiversity Platform](http://www.biodiversity.be)) and the many volunteer observers to make this possible.

> [Watervogels - Wintering waterbirds in Flanders, Belgium](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/7f9eb622-c036-44c6-8be9-5793eaa1fa1e) contains more than 80,000 bird counts, covering almost **640,000 observations** and 37 million individuals for the period 1991-2014. It includes information on 170 species in nearly 1,200 wetland sites. The aim of these bird counts is to gather information on the size, distribution and long term trends of wintering waterbird populations in Flanders. These data are also used to assess the importance of individual sites for waterbirds, using quantitative criteria. Furthermore, the waterbird counts contribute to international monitoring programs, such as the International Waterbird Census (coordinated by Wetlands International) and fulfil some of the objectives of the European Bird Directive, the Ramsar Convention, and the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). The data are released in bulk as open data. See the dataset metadata for contact information, scope and methodology.
