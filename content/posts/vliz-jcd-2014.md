We will be presenting some preliminary results from our bird tracking network at the [VLIZ Young Marine Scientists' Day](http://www.vliz.be/jcd/en) on March 7 in Brugge. The study is conducted in close collaboration with the [Terrestrial Ecological Unit (TEREC)](http://www.ecology.ugent.be/terec/) of the University of Ghent, the [Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)](www.vliz.be/en) and [UvA-BiTS](http://www.uva-bits.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam.

Here we report on the specific movements of one breeding [Lesser Black-backed Gull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Black-backed_Gull) and two [Herring Gulls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Herring_Gull) during and after breeding season, showing how the movements of the gulls vary during the course of the breeding season and fluctuate with tidal movements. The movements are visualized with [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com), an open source tool to visualize and analyze geospatial data on the web (see also [our previous post]({filename}tracking-eric.md)).
