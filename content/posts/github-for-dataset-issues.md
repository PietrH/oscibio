Summary: How we use GitHub to track issues and metadata of our published biodiversity datasets.

Part of our mission in building an open terrestrial and freshwater observatory is the rapid publication[^1] of the biodiversity data it generates. In addition, we unlock data that have been collected and managed by [our institute](http://www.inbo.be) over the last two decades. The bulk of these data are occurrence data, which we publish as [open](http://opendefinition.org), standardized, well-documented, [GBIF-registered](http://www.gbif.org) [Darwin Core Archives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) on our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://data.inbo.be/ipt).

[^1]: The term [data publishing](http://www.pensoft.net/page.php?P=23) is used, as making biodiversity data available online is not unlike traditional publishing of research results.

Also guidelines

IPT, workflow, guidelines, high standard (rigourous review)

Inspired by 1) dataset post, 2) vascan and 3) vertnet, we also went for this.

## New workflow

* see verify dataset

## Issues

* labels
* assigning
* 

## Metadata

* Nice format
* Wish could be extracted directly from IPT
* Wish it could be tracked and submitted that way to papers accepting data papers

## Datasets that have a repo
