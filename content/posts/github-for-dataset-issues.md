Summary: How we use GitHub to track issues and metadata of our published biodiversity datasets.
Status: draft

Part of our mission in building an open terrestrial and freshwater observatory is the rapid publication[^1] of the biodiversity data it generates. In addition, we unlock data that have been collected and managed by [our institute](http://www.inbo.be) over the last two decades. The bulk of these data are occurrence data, which we publish as [open](http://opendefinition.org), standardized, well-documented, [GBIF-registered](http://www.gbif.org) [Darwin Core Archives](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive) on our [GBIF Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT)](http://data.inbo.be/ipt).

[^1]: The term [data publishing](http://www.pensoft.net/page.php?P=23) is used, as making biodiversity data available online is not unlike traditional publishing of research results.

## Open issue tracking for data

Even though we rigorously review our (to be) published data with tools such as [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/), there will always be errors and inconsistencies in our data. Inspired by the **open issue tracking** by [Canadensys](http://data.canadensys.net/vascan) for the Database of Vascular Plants of Canada (VASCAN), the [OKFN Labs](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/11/06/tracking-data-issues.html) for public datasets, and [VertNet](http://blog.vertnet.org/post/74297660841/issue-tracking-available-in-the-vertnet-portal-at) for specimen data, we have started to do the same.

...


Each dataset now has its repository on GitHub. In the README, we provide a short description of the dataset (including a link), a link to the published dataset and , where we provide a short description in the README and link to the pu

Also guidelines

IPT, workflow, guidelines, high standard (rigourous review)

Inspired by 1) dataset post, 2) vascan and 3) vertnet, we also went for this.

## New workflow

* see verify dataset

## Issues

* labels
* assigning
* 

## Metadata

* Nice format
* Wish could be extracted directly from IPT
* Wish it could be tracked and submitted that way to papers accepting data papers

## Datasets that have a repo

* 6
