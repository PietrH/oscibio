The article includes quotes from Peter Desmet about the visualizations we made at LifeWatch INBO for our bird tracking network (see [previous]({filename}tracking-eric.md) [posts]({filename}jcd-2014.md)) and the online version even features the interactive [bird migration flow visualization]({filename}bird-migration-flow-visualization.md) we developed for the [European Network for the Radar Surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM)](http://enram.eu).
