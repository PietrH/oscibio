### Bart Aelterman - Analyst

Bart interviews the researchers involved to figure out their exact needs. He then translates those needs to software requirements with the help of processes, diagrams, mockups, and coffee. During his train commute, Bart is a [bioinformatics-hacker](http://bioinformatics-man.blogspot.be/), wishing he had wifi-access.
