## LifeWatch

LifeWatch is a European research infrastructure (ESFRI) established to develop a distributed virtual laboratory. It will consist of several biodiversity observatories, data repositories, web services, and modeling tools.
Since 2012 the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en) and the [Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)](http://www.vliz.be/EN/INTRO) form the Flemish LifeWatch consortium, which is funded through the [Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)](http://www.fwo.be/en/).

Our team at LifeWatch INBO is responsible for implementing a long-term **terrestrial and freshwater observatory** using high-tech monitoring equipment such as GPS trackers and camera traps, unlocking the data it generates as open data, and providing researchers the tools and documentation to interact with those data in reproducible workflows.

Further background information about the project can be found on [lifewatch.be](http://www.lifewatch.be/project).
