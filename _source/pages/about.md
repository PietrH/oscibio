## LifeWatch

LifeWatch is a European research infrastructure (ESFRI) established to develop a distributed virtual laboratory. It will consist of several biodiversity observatories, data repositories, web services, and modeling tools.
Since 2012 the [Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO)](https://www.inbo.be/en) and the [Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)](http://www.vliz.be/EN/INTRO) form the Flemish LifeWatch consortium, which is funded through the [Hercules Foundation](http://www.fwo.be/en/the-fwo/organisation/fwo-expertpanels/research-infrastructure/commissie-hercules-invest/).

Our team at LifeWatch INBO is responsible for the development of a **terrestrial and freshwater observatory** in collaboration with the researchers at the INBO, using high-tech monitoring equipment such as GPS trackers, unmanned airplanes, and radar, as well the development of the web services which will provide the collected data as open data.

Further background information about the project can be found on [lifewatch.be](http://www.lifewatch.be/project).
