# LifeWatch INBO blog

This repository contains the content and settings for the [LifeWatch INBO blog](http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog). It is generated as a static website with [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com).

## 1. Write a post

1. Create a new post in `_source/posts` on the `master` branch, either locally or on GitHub. See the other posts for syntax and required metadata.
2. Commit and push your changes.
3. Ask for feedback via a pull request (`master` â†’ `gh-pages`)
4. Incorporate the feedback

Your posts is now 2 steps away from being published on the website.

## 2. Generate the website

You need Pelican to convert your post into static HTML and update the RSS, homepage, and necessary author/category pages. Ask one of the contributors to do it for you or install all the necessary components yourself:

### Get the blog and theme repo

    git clone https://github.com/inbo/lifewatch-blog
    git clone https://github.com/inbo/eurasian-spoonbill

The latter one is the theme of the website and required to generate the correct output.

### Create and activate an environment

Here we create an environment with [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html):

    conda create -n pelican python=3.5 pelican markdown --channel conda-forge

To activate:

    source activate pelican

To deactivate:

    source deactivate

### Generate the website

    cd lifewatch-blog/_source
    pelican -s dev-settings.py

Use the `--autoreload` option to generate the site on every change.

### Preview the website

In a new terminal tab:

    python http.server 8000

Which will serve the website at <http://localhost:8000/dev-output>

## Publish the website

1. Update the post date and time.
2. Generate the website one last time, this time with the production settings: `pelican -s settings.py`.
3. Commit and push the generated files.
4. Accept the pull request.

Your changes are now included in the `gh-pages` branch, which serves the website at http://inbo.github.io/lifewatch-blog = http://lifewatch.inbo.be/blog.
