The [Toolbox special in the current issue of Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/519119a) discusses the (new) geospatial visualization tools that are available to researchers - such as CartoDB and TileMill:

The article includes quotes from Peter Desmet about the visualizations we made at LifeWatch INBO for our bird tracking network (see [previous]({% post_url 2013-10-01-tracking-eric %}) [posts]({% post_url 2014-01-22-jcd-2014 %})) and the online version even features the interactive [bird migration flow visualization]({% post_url 2014-06-10-bird-migration-flow-visualization %}) we developed for the [European Network for the Radar Surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM)](http://enram.eu).
